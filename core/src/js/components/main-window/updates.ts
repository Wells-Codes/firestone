			// 		Instead of using giveaways to get more people to like and follow a Twitter account, I would like to use this opportunity to thank all of you who have been using Firestone so far. You don't need to do anything to enter, I will simply pick someone at random who has played at least a match between 2021-02-15 and 2021-02-25 (while using Firestone, otherwise I have no way to know).
			// 		<br/>
			// 		ATTENTION: you need to have created an account and be logged in Overwolf so that I can contact you.
			// 		<br/>
			// 		<br/>
			// 		If you want to spread the love of the app though, please feel free to do so :) The more people use the app, the more relevant the stats and global info become, and the closer I can get to be a real full-time Firestone dev, which would let me keep the flow of updates going :)
